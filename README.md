### Datasets
There are eight mainstream RGB-D saliency datasets:

|Dataset|DES/RGBD135|DUT-RGBD|LFSD|NJUD|NLPR|SIP|SSD|STEREO
|Size|135|1200|100|2000|1000|929|80|1000/797|



There are two generally accepted settings of training datasets:
- Training dataset 1, including NJUD and NLPR

- Training dataset 1, including 
- alt表示图片显示失败时的替换文本
- alt表示图片显示失败时的替换文本


a ready-to-use download package, including all test sets, and two popular training sets in the RGB-D Saliency Detection.

将网络生成的sal maps放到evaluation_tool文件夹下，运行calculate metrics即可计算评价指标
